# Guild Administration & Player Status Tracker

## Overview

This project is a web application designed for administering guilds and displaying the status of each player within those guilds. It provides tools for guild leaders or administrators to manage guild membership, activities, and player progression, while offering a clear view of player statuses for all guild members.

Built with Laravel for the backend API and React for the frontend user interface, this application aims to be a robust and interactive platform for guild communities.

## Features

*   **Guild Management:** Create, update, and delete guilds.
*   **Player Management:** Add, remove, and manage players within guilds.
*   **Status Tracking:** Display real-time or regularly updated status for each player (e.g., online/offline, current activity, level, achievements - *you can customize this based on your specific game or context*).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (Optional):** Differentiate permissions for guild administrators and regular members.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login for users/players.
*   **Responsive UI:** User interface adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Laravel (PHP Framework)
*   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript Library)
*   **Database:** (Specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
*   **Web Server:** (Specify your web server, e.g., Nginx, Apache)
*   **Potentially:** WebSockets (e.g., Laravel Echo, Socket.io) for real-time status updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   PHP (>= version specified in your `composer.json`, e.g., 8.1)
*   Composer (PHP dependency manager)
*   Node.js (>= version specified in your `package.json`, e.g., 18.x or 20.x)
*   NPM or Yarn (Node package manager)
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Laravel):**
    ```bash
    # Install PHP dependencies
    composer install

    # Copy the .env.example file to .env
    cp .env.example .env

    # Generate an application key
    php artisan key:generate

    # Configure your .env file with database credentials and other settings
    # DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    # DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    # DB_PORT=3306
    # DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    # DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
    # DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

    # Run database migrations (and seeders if you have them)
    php artisan migrate --seed

    # Link storage (if you use public disk for uploads)
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (React):**
    Assuming your React app is within a directory like `resources/js` or `frontend`.
    If it's in the root, adjust paths accordingly.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to your React app directory (if applicable)
    # cd resources/js 

    # Install JavaScript dependencies
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install

    # Build assets for development or production
    npm run dev
    # or for production
    # npm run build
    ```

4.  **Serve the Application:**

    *   **Laravel Development Server (for API):**
        ```bash
        php artisan serve
        ```
        This will typically start the Laravel backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

    *   **React Development Server (if using Vite or Create React App's dev server):**
        Your `npm run dev` command for React might start its own development server (e.g., on `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite with Laravel).
        Ensure your Laravel API and React frontend can communicate (check proxy settings in Vite config or `setupProxy.js` for Create React App if needed).

    *   **Alternatively, if Laravel serves your React build (e.g., via Blade):**
        `php artisan serve` might be sufficient, and `npm run build` would be the command to compile your React assets into Laravel's `public` directory.

## Usage

*   Access the application through your browser, typically `http://localhost:8000` (if Laravel serves everything) or the port your React dev server uses.
*   Register a new user account or log in if you have existing credentials.
*   **Guild Administration:** (Describe how an admin would create/manage guilds and players)
*   **Player Status Viewing:** (Describe how users can view player statuses)

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables to configure in your `.env` file:

*   `APP_NAME`: Name of your application.
*   `APP_ENV`: Application environment (`local`, `staging`, `production`).
*   `APP_KEY`: Application encryption key (generated by `php artisan key:generate`).
*   `APP_DEBUG`: Enable/disable debug mode (`true` for local, `false` for production).
*   `APP_URL`: Base URL of your application.

*   `DB_CONNECTION`: Database connection type (e.g., `mysql`).
*   `DB_HOST`: Database host.
*   `DB_PORT`: Database port.
*   `DB_DATABASE`: Database name.
*   `DB_USERNAME`: Database username.
*   `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password.

*   `VITE_APP_URL` (if using Vite and Laravel): `${"APP_URL"}` - ensures Vite uses the correct base URL for assets.
*   (Add any other specific environment variables your application uses, e.g., for external APIs, Pusher credentials for WebSockets, etc.)

## API Endpoints (Optional)

If you have a separate API that the React frontend consumes, you might want to list key endpoints here. For example:

*   `GET /api/guilds` - List all guilds
*   `POST /api/guilds` - Create a new guild
*   `GET /api/guilds/{id}` - Get a specific guild
*   `GET /api/guilds/{guild_id}/players` - List players in a guild
*   `GET /api/players/{id}/status` - Get a player's status
